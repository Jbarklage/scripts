Veeam Backup for Proxmox VE - Workers:
Veeam Backup for Proxmox VE uses Workers to backup Proxmox VMs in the same way as Veeam Backup & Replication uses Proxy Servers for vSphere VMs. Every worker will process VM data when transferring data to and from backup repositories.

This script allows the communcation between Veeam Backup and Replication and Proxmox VE, so Veeam can manage Proxmox VMs
